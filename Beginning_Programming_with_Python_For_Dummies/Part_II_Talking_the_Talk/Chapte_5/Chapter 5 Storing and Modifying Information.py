=====================================
Using the right box to store the data
=====================================

just keep in mind that each kind of information is stored in a special kind
of variable.

However,
computers don’t actually know about information types. All that the computer
knows about are 0s and 1s, which is the absence or presence of a voltage.


Numbers, letters, dates, times, and any other kind of information
you can think about all come down to 0s and 1s in the computer system.

Defining the Essential Python Data Types
========================================

Every programming language defines variables that hold specific kinds of
information, and Python is no exception. The specific kind of variable is
called a data type.
